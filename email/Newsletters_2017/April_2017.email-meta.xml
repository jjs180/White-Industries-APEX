Local Support: Business After Hours

Dalby Chamber of Commerce Business After Hours

Business After Hours is an informal, social get-together aimed at showcasing local businesses and providing a great opportunity for networking. White Industries hosted the evening for March, with a record attendance of over 230 people. It was an opportunity for local businesses to see what goes on behind the gates at White Industries.

We remained open, with production in full swing while conducting group tours through the Foundry for all could follow the casting process.

Australia to Invest in Snowy Mountains Hydro Power

caption: Snowy Hydro&apos;s Tumut Generating Station

The federal government has announced a 50 percent expansion of the output of the Snowy Hydro Scheme. The proposed plan would involve a new series of tunnels and power stations to better utilise the existing Snowy Hydro infrastructure, rather than build new dams.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull claimed that the new plan will add 2000MW of power to the scheme’s existing 4100MW output and will power 500,000 homes. Four different design options using the Scheme’s existing dams will be looked at. The leading options are to rework the Tantangara Reservoir and the Talbingo Reservoir.

Turnbull said that his plan is better than the giant battery storage facility that South Australia’s premier Jay Wetherill has unveiled. “In one hour it could produce 20 times the 100MW per hour expected from the battery proposed by the South Australian government, but would deliver it constantly for almost a week, or 350,000 MWh over seven days,” Turnbull said.

However, the state is unlikely to back away from its plan. It wants to build South Australia’s generation capacity and contribution to the National Energy Market so it can export excess energy to Australia’s eastern seaboard.



Heat Treatment Facility

White Industries operates six natural gas-fired heat treatment ovens and an agitated water quench facility to provide a wide range of thermal treatments such as annealing, stress relief, normalising, hardening and tempering. All ovens are fitted with digital controllers that are programmed for precise heating rates and hold times. The ovens are  equipped with digital recorders to maintain traceability of thermal cycles.

This enables White Industries to offer customers, steel and iron castings to exacting specifications, as well as a subcontracted heat treatment service.
