Fire Audit - Keeping your investment safe

We hold hundreds of thousands of customers&apos; dollars in patterns on-site, and as part of the ongoing and proactive process of risk minimisation, White Industries partner with the Dalby Fire Brigade to perform an on-site familiarisation and audit, to ensure smooth operation in the unlikely event of an emergency situation.

Captain Peter Mauch, along with 20 fire personel and three trucks, spent two hours at the foundry performing fire drills using their own water supply and the in-ground fire hydrant, testing for accessibility, flow and pressure.

Jason Manteit our Machine Shop Manager showed them through the machine shop, including where they can and can’t spray water, access doorways and isolation points for electricity. Locations were also noted for the chemical storage sheds outside and the two large pattern storage sheds running adjacent to the Machine Shop.

Mick Shelford our Foundry Manager took them through the Pattern Shop and Foundry showing the power supply termination points, transformer locations/isolators, mains gas inlets/isolators and general layout of each area and their respected fire hazards. The main plant/equipment and energy inputs were noted in each of these areas.

This is a great example of White Industries&apos; commitment to service and to provide you, its valued clients with piece of mind that your patern investments are safe and that your supply line is risk adverse.


Forum Evening - Australian Foundry Institute

Late last year, White Industries hosted the Queensland Division of the Australian Foundry Institute (AFI). The institute is made up of foundries, foundry supply companies and foundry personnel, with the aim to share knowledge, promote personnel training and to provide an industry forum.

The Institute meets regularly, to provide personnel with the latest innovations in foundary equipment and techniques.

The evening included a plant tour of the White Industries modern foundry, fabrication and machining facilities and a presentation by White Industries’ Adrian Lambert, the QLD AFI Moulding Achiever of the Year. Adrian shared his key learning points and experiences with the forum and provided an overview of his experience at the recent AFI national convention in Melbourne.

White Industries is proud to be a member of the AFI, with Bob, Bruce and Craig White having served as committee members and office holders over the years.

Trade Futures Award- Supporting Our Community

Dalby State High School had its annual award night in November, with White Industries sponsoring the Trade Futures award for the fifth consecutive year.

Craig White, our CEO, was on hand to present the award to the hard working and well deserved winner, Ryan Spencer.

The Trade Futures program sees local industry mentors &quot;adopt&quot; students as they engage in regular on-site work. The program allows students to take their skills and apply them in real world situations and market their abilites to potential employers on a first hand basis.

White Industries is the major sponsor of the trade training centre at the school.

New Foundry Investment: Heat Treatment Ovens

Over the last two and half months we have been busy commissioning two new high temperature, bogie drive, heat treatment ovens.

These new ovens increase our capacity by 45%, raising the heat treatment facility production capacities inline with the other sections of the foundry.

Up to 40% gas efficiency with pulse firing burners
PLC controls with electronic graph recording
SCADA interface enabling communication with plant wide monitoring systems.

Oven Specifications:

Length: 4000mm x Width: 1600mm x Height: 1300mm (Internal Dimensions) up to 1100C
Length: 2100mm x Width: 1600mm x Height: 1300mm (Internal Dimensions) up to 750C




Design Launch: New 30 ton Grain Buggy

White Industries have been designing and producing innovative grain buggies for the agricultural market since the early 70’s. Our latest offering sees the familiar functionality, but a dramatic change in design and capacity.

Early bin designs were limited to approximately 100 bags or eight tons on a single axle. We can now offer 30 ton bins, on a special design rocking beam with dual axle. This new design allows for 40 degrees of osculation, or in layman’s terms 700mm of travel.

The other radical change decends from the automotive industry, with bolting sections of the bin together instead of welding. This innovation allows us to be the only Australian manufacturer to powder coat their bins instead of painting them. The automotive industry has been using this method since the turn of the century and has stood the test of time.

Other key features are:

No rams or hydraulics oils inside the bin
Large sight glasses front and rear of the bin
Oversize door on rear of bin for easy access
18 inch augers with 19 inch diameter barrel
Emptying time of 12 ½ ton per minute

Field Trials of the new bin were carried out during the last wheat harvest in northern NSW with great success. The farm testing the bin was so impressed with it&apos;s performance, they have decided to purchase it. We have another two bins currently in production for the upcoming harvest.

If you are interested in one or would like to know more about them give Neil White a call on Ph 1300 825 980 or mob 0427 623 376 or email neil.white@whiteindustries.com.au.

Queensland government gas pilot program shows the way

The Queensland government’s gas pilot program provides good template for how gas could be developed on Australia’s eastern seaboard, according to Manufacturing Australia.

The program provides a piece of land in the Surat Basin for gas extraction solely by domestic companies and manufacturers.

If gas intensive manufacturing is to continue in Australia we need more gas, more gas suppliers and the right policies in place to ensure new gas development actually benefits local businesses,

“Queensland has lots of gas. We should be able to have the best of both worlds: gas for manufacturing and gas for export,” he said.

In recent years, manufacturers have often failed to secure long-term gas contracts because of the country’s focus on maximising export- revenue from cheap LNG exports.


Australian manufacturing experiencing jobs growth

The Australian manufacturing sector is experiencing new jobs growth according to The Australian Manufacturing Growth Centre (AMGC).

Manufacturing is also now growing. It employs 902,000 people, up from 859,500 in February 2016. Manufacturing now represents 7.6 per cent of the Australian workforce.

The recovery in the employment numbers shows a strong sentiment to Australian manufacturing. This is also evidenced by the increase in the Performance of Manufacturing Index by 1.2 points to 55.4 from February 2017 to December 2016. The Index is an Ai Group seasonally adjusted national composite index based on the diffusion indices for production, new orders, deliveries, inventories and employment with varying weights.

Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre managing director Dr Jens Goennemann said that there are a lot of reasons to be positive about Australian manufacturing.

“There’s a lot to cheer about and our manufacturing strength should be one of those Aussie successes we raise a glass to and toast,” Goennemann said.

The AMGC has released its Growth Competitiveness Plan, which shows that manufacturing has the potential to add $36 billion to the economy over the next ten years.

The Evolution of Metal Casting Part IV

1947   The Shell Process, invented by J. Croning of Germany during WWII, is discovered by U.S. officials and made public.
1948   Development of ductile iron, a cast iron with a fully spheroidal graphite structure.
1949   U.S. patent granted to K.D. Millis, A.P. Gagnebin and N.B. Pilling of International Nickel Company for developing ductile iron.
1953   The Hotbox system of making and curing cores in one operation is developed, eliminating the need for dielectric drying ovens.
1958   H.F. Shroyer is granted a patent for the full mould process, the forerunner of the expendable pattern (lost foam) casting process.
1960s   Compactibility and methylene blue clay tests are developed for green sand control. Also developed at this time are high-pressure moulding processes and fast-setting no bake binders for sand.
1964   The first disamatic moulding machine is introduced.
1965   The Scanning Electron Microscope is invented by the Cambridge University Engineering Department in England.
1965   Cast metal matrix composites are first poured at International Nickel Company in Sterling Forest, NY, by Pradeep Rohatgi.
1968   The Cold Box Process is introduced by L. Toriello and J. Robins for high production core.
