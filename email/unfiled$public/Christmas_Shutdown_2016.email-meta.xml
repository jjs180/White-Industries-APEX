Christmas Shutdown

Dear Customer

Please be advised that White Industries will be closing for our annual Christmas Shutdown on Thursday 22nd December 2016.
We will recommence production on Tuesday 17th January 2017.
Dispatch of goods will not be possible during this period.

As we generally have at least a 4 – 6 week lead time, it would be appreciated if all customers place their orders with this timetable in mind.
Should you have any questions regarding this shutdown period please do not hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards
Craig White
CEO
