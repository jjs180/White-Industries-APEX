The Whites Behind White Industries


The White family: founder Bob White and his wife Yvonne centre with Samantha (Bruce’s Daughter), on the left Neil and Bruce, on the right Craig and his wife Donna.

Every year in Australia, a conference is held to celebrate businesses owned and run by families, and this year it was held on the Gold Coast in September. 458 delegates from 60 family owned businesses attended, “This is the backbone of Australia and how it was built. It’s good to see all these families coming together to exchange ideas and encourage each other to keep their businesses evolving and improving” said Craig White. The oldest family represented were the Sadleirs, who began business activities in Perth in 1829.

White Industries was started in 1960 by Bob White, and is now managed by second generation brothers Bruce, Craig and Neil.

The World View
Casting Costs

There’s never been a better time to reap the benefits of Australian quality manufacturing, with high international costs, predicted to increase.

Manufacturing conditions are well above where they stood last year, thanks to low interest rates and a sharp drop in the Australian dollar. Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan said a 25 per cent drop in the Australian dollar in the past two years and low interest rates have been a positive for business. &quot;The manufacturing sector is on the right side of both of these developments,&quot; Mr Hanlan said last week.

The manufacturing sector in Australia has expanded for a second straight month as residential building activity and strong demand for food and beverages continues to benefit downstream manufacturing suppliers, a performance survey says.

The Australian Industry Group performance of manufacturing index rose 1.3 points to 51.7 in August. &quot;A second month of expansion is encouraging for Australian manufacturing,&quot; AI Group Chief Executive, Innes Willox said.
