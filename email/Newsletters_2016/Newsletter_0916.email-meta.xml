QME 2016 Done and dusted for another year

Queensland Mining and Engineering Exhibition 2016 was another successful expo. This year there were around 200 local and global exhibitors including China, Poland, and the US.
Alongside White Industries exhibiting, there was Toyota, SEW Eurodrive, ESS Engineering, Flexco, Metso, and Endress + Hauser. SEW Eurodrive announced its plans to open a new facility in Mackay early next year.


Despite the current mining slump, there was still strong attendance at the event.

Join us at Land Forces Expo 2016

The Land Forces exhibition is on again at the Adelaide Convention Centre, from 5th September until 8th September. This is an international industry exposition to showcase equipment, technology and services for the armies of Australia, Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Australia&apos;s defence forces are embarking on a period of significant acquisition and modernisation with acquisition projects worth more than AUD$150 billion planned for the next decade. The Australian Army alone is planning to spend nearly AUD$30 billion on equipment, services and new combat capabilities.

We will be exhibiting at stand #AU13 so please come by and have a chat with us. For further details on the event and to pre-register, head to http://www.landforces.com.au.


Did you know we also make street furniture

Well not exactly, but Street &amp; Garden did approach us to work with them on a project for their client, Hobart City Council. Street &amp; Garden are an award winning team of industrial designers who specialise in furniture design for public spaces.

Hobart City Council wanted to revitalise Franklin Square and this entailed a series of seating elements that included a large 12m long sweeping curved bench seat. Given the heritage nature of the site, a major aspect of the project was that any new furniture element needed to relate back to the original designs. The original furniture utilised castings, and this is where White Industries was able to deliver the feet of the bench seats to be able to reflect its historical roots. These cast elements were then paired with fabricated sheet metal elements and a customised pattern details inspired by aspects of the site.

As part of our continuous reinvestment policy, we have launched today our brand new website! White Industries not only invests in machinery and tools but also acknowledges the importance of having up to date technology in order to reflect the global environment we work in.
