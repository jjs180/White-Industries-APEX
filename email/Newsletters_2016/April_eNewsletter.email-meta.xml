A Passionate Community Contributor

White Industries has long been an enthusiastic benefactor to the local community here in Dalby.  One of the local projects we have been a proud contributor to is the Trade Training program which has been running through the Dalby State High School, which not just trains students in their particular industry of choice, but also allows them to utilise their learned skills on site within a real industry environment and regularly market themselves to potential employers.  White Industries has always been a supporter of this outstanding program by providing mentoring opportunities and technical support.

This year we’ve increased our support by donating Personal Protection Equipment and Plant Equipment to the value of $10,000 – this has allowed for all year 11 Trade Training Students to be kitted out with their own personal welding and PPE kit, ensuring that they are safe when continuing learning their trade.  White Industries are planning to follow this contribution up by donating a Pipe and Section Roller which will be there for the students to access and increase their experience with industry standard equipment. White Industries has been honoured to be part of this incredibly beneficial program as we believe that the future of our local community relies on investing in the future of our local youth.

White Industries Team  15 Years of Service

We first crossed paths with Glenn Fryer when investigating the possibility of buying Rocklea Foundry in Brisbane.  We instantly knew this fellow knew everything there was to know about his customers, part numbers and quantities – as well as his experience as a Moulder.  We knew we had to have him as part of our team.

Craig White, Glenn Fryer, Bruce White and Neil White

Glenn came to Dalby late 2001 to work with our Dalby team after we’d bought Rocklea business and closed the premises.  He initially spent the first few years back on the floor as a Moulder, immersing himself in exactly how White Industries functioned and gaining insight with our part numbers and jobs.  Glenn also took this chance to establish excellent working relationships with our customers, ensuring they were receiving the best possible service.  Glenn has since moved into a desk role in the office and oversees the costings, payroll, spare parts as well as being the face for White Industries to all of our customers.

Congratulations and thank you for fifteen years of valuable service, Glenn!

Newest White Industries Members

We are very excited to introduce the newest members of our White Industries team. As you can see from the picture, this time it’s a little different from usual with us mixing up the species seeing as our two newest additions to the team are of the four legged, canine variety. These two fine specimens have been recruited as part our security team and they will be adding to the security of the premises after production has shut down at night and on weekends. Don’t be deceived by their good looks, these two both hold black belts in martial arts.

Michael Shelford with the new team members

Thankfully our Foundry Manager, Michael Shelford (aka Mick), has been keeping our newest recruits under control. As well as being our resident dog whisperer, Mick is also in charge of ensuring all production is on time and the quality of our castings are of the highest standard. He is also a qualified metallurgist and has vast experience with all metals and production methods. There’s no shortage of talent at White Industries!

Volvo Group Australia Calls Brisbane Home

Volvo Group President and CEO Martin Lundstedt has announced the launch of Volvo Group Australia’s new $30 million headquarters and dealership in Wacol. To be located at the Metroplex Westgate business park near their assembly plant, Walcol was deemed the perfect home base for the Australian Volvo division considering Volvo Group have been building trucks in Brisbane for more than 40 years.

Despite the decline in manufacturing within Australia in recent years, Volvo Group has confidence in the Australian market and look to gain further competitive advantage by investing in local manufacturing.  This confidence is reflected in the excess of $27 million dollars that is being invested in this project as well as in the skills of local employees. Volvo Group Australia president Peter Voorhoeve reiterates the importance of utilising the specialised local manufacturing skills here in Australia – especially taking into account that &quot;Australia is the toughest trucking environment in the world and it makes sense for us to build locally the specific trucks that the market demands”. The new headquarters and Brisbane South dealership are due to open in late-2017.

Iron Ore Price Spikes 19 per cent

Following the Chinese government pledging to increase their spending on constructing railways and roads, the iron ore price has posted its largest one-day gain. Iron ore spiked an incredible 19 per cent to $US62.60 a tonne, compared with $US52.40 in the previous session as a direct response to the Chinese Government announcing their intention to increase target growth from 6.5% to 7% this year, which greatly encouraged investors.  While this is positive news to the iron ore mining industry, there has been mixed feelings from observers regarding how long this price increase will remain for.

Inland Rail Project Progresses with Awarding Contracts

The Inland Rail project made exciting progress with the awarding of more than $11million in contracts recently. The contracts include a range of essential field studies and environmental impact assessments across Queensland, NSW and Victoria. Inland Rail holds enormous potential in boosting regional economic growth and driving national productivity by providing a reliable, dedicated and cost effective freight link from Melbourne to Brisbane, including vital linkages to Sydney, Adelaide and Perth.
