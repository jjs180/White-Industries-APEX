We Have Been Getting Out There

White Industries attended the National Manufacturing Week held 11-13 May in Sydney. There were 200 exhibitors, 50 speakers and over 5,000 attendees. This year’s theme focused on innovation and collaboration. Sessions held discussed opportunities for manufacturers to break down the barriers to innovation. It was a great exhibition and gave White Industries the opportunity to meet both new and existing clients face to face.


Our next stop will be at the Queensland Mining and Engineering Exhibition being held in Mackay on the 26th to 28th of July. This exhibition hosts approximately 650 exhibitors and is expected to attract over 12,500 attendees. There will be live demos, free seminars and a ‘Thought Leadership Panel’ led by Mick Buffier (Chairman, World Coal Association). Craig White (Sales &amp; Marketing Director) and Jim Stevenson (Business Development Manager) will be there representing White Industries. We welcome all our customers to attend and it would be great to see you there.

The Evolution of Metal Casting

Metal casting can be traced back some 5,000 years. It is one of the most important manufacturing processes in the world. We will trace the history of metal casting over our next couple of newsletters. Metal casting is crucial to modern civilisation and is an essential element to any design structure.

The beginning of metal casting…

3200 B.C. - A copper frog, the oldest known casting in existence, is cast in Mesopotamia.
2000 B.C. - Iron is discovered. 800-700 B.C. The first Chinese production of cast iron.
645 B.C. - Earliest known sand moulding (China).
233 B.C. - Cast iron ploughshares are poured in China.
500 A.D. - Cast crucible steel is first produced in India, but the process is lost until 1750 when Benjamin Huntsman reinvents it in England.
