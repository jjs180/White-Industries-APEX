2016 is here!
and we can&apos;t wait to see you.

Good afternoon! The White Industries Team is excited to be back in the office after its much-deserved annual shut down.

The White family always enjoys the holiday season together, taking the opportunity to wind down, chat about everything that’s happened in the year gone by, and make a few plans. It’s quite an achievement to start another year (number 56!) together as a family business, with our team so dedicated to what we do.

Let us give you an update on one of our projects planned for this new year. Set to launch soon is a new website that will become a portal for all the technical information and news from the foundry. Join our Facebook page to stay tuned for updates. http://www.facebook.com/whiteindustriesdalby

White Industries on the road

White Industries will be busy throughout the 2016 calendar year attending a number of industry events:
Calendar of Trade Shows for 2016 National Manufacturing Week Sydney : 11 – 13 May 2016
Queensland Mining &amp; Engineering Exhibition MacKay : 26 – 28 July 2016
Land Forces 2016 Adelaide : 6 -8 September 2016

Let our team know if you will be attending any of these busy shows and we can organise a time to meet with you one-on-one there: Contact Us

Our factory is also open for tours if you’d like to visit in person – just let us know! Come and look first hand at the foundry processes we use, and highly technical items we are able to produce.

See you there!

White Industries Team

In the foundry, we find husband and wife team; Steve and Rochelle Gallagher, from Dalby. Working with family is part of the White Industries spirit, being a family owned business for nearly sixty years.



While Steve runs the melt deck, you can find Rochelle in the team operating the German manufactured BMD line. Outside of White Industries, they spend time fishing, camping and caravanning.

Mining in 2016: Six Reasons to be Cheerful
As we look back at 2015, when the price of metals and minerals lost more ground, it was a stressful time for many businesses and families around Australia. Research firm Capital Economics, delivers an outlook for commodities in 2016:

According to Julian Jessop, Head of Commodities Research at their London-based company, there are six key themes to consider that they believe will help prices recover over the next twelve months.

China gears up: The bulk of the slowdown that many still fear lies ahead, has in fact already happened.  Estimates the actual growth was only 4.5% or so this year, and we expect economic activity to pick up pace again during 2016.

Dollar damage done: The strengthening greenback “has both lowered the dollar price that (non-US) consumers are able to pay and allowed commodity producers with revenues in dollars and costs in local currencies to maintain supply at a high level,” but the “bulk of this move should now be over too”.

Inflation returns: Underlying price pressures are finally starting to pick-up, notably in the US – and headline inflation rates should rebound in the coming months as the biggest declines in the cost of oil drop out at the annual comparisons. This, in turn, could revive demand for inflation hedges including commodities, with gold in particular likely to benefit.

More easy money: While the Fed will continue to raise rates in 2016, it would be because of a stronger economy and higher inflation, keeping real interest rates low. Europe and Japan will continue or accelerate its quantitative easing programs while the People’s Bank of China has plenty of room to ease further.

Supply cuts: On top of better news on the demand side, a recovery in the prices of many industrial commodities will probably require further evidence that supply is being tamed by the previous sharp falls. Some metals prices already appear to have found a floor following the announcement of large cutbacks in production and new investment.

Investor interest: While investor sentiment towards commodities is still at record lows, the flipside is that there is plenty of room for money to return to the sector. Indeed, commodity prices may look increasingly attractive relative to high valuations of equities and (especially) bonds. We would not expect investor demand to trigger a rebound in price on its own. But, speculative flows could support any recovery driven by the underlying fundamentals of supply and demand, just as highly negative sentiment has compounded the recent weakness.

Are the Big Duo Getting out of Coal Mining?
BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, both recognised as the largest miners in Australia, are quietly selling their coal mines. Rio has generated around $US2 billion ($2.8 billion) from the sale of thermal coal mines. On the other hand, BHP recently entered into a demerger agreement with South32 and gained much from this deal.

Rio Tinto’s exit from the thermal coal market has paved way for the sale of its Hunter Valley-based Mount Pleasant project. According to Rio, “It has made a deal to offload its Mount Pleasant coal assets to MACH Energy Australia for $US224 million plus royalties”.

Combining the sale of Rio’s interest to a coal joint venture with Bengalla, the miner received $US830m from the sale, despite a string of divestments since 2013 amounting to $US4.7 billion.
New Metals
Another great development we are keeping our eye on in mining is the discovery of new metals. Scandium, similar to titanium is a metal found in Australia in world-leading amounts and with a little work, it could offer big industrial opportunities.

Brent Balinski reports on a recently announced effort to help address the material’s supply and demand nexus; “Due to the minuscule output globally of scandium, this metal is quite expensive because of its usefulness in aluminum alloys that could bring change to aerospace and other industries”.

Scandium is among the 17 rare earth elements and was only discovered in 1879. The very first half-kilogram of scandium was produced in 1960. In today’s generation, the world’s estimate on scandium production varies between five and 20 tonnes.

The benefits of local supply

There are countless benefits for choosing a local manufacturer over an importing supplier and among these are:

No hidden charges This is one of the biggest advantages for choosing a domestic manufacturer over an importing supplier. There are no hidden costs that customers will need to pay on the final billing unlike buying overseas from an importer.
No third party issues Another awesome benefit of choosing a domestic manufacturer is in having limited third party issues like shipment delays or wharf issues. Aside from that, the customer need not worry about foreign currency exchange rates, since transactions are all in Australian Dollars.
No communication barrier If you transact with a local manufacturer, communication won’t be an issue, since both parties speak the same language whereas if you are considering an import supplier there might be difficulty in relaying detailed information.
Competent advice When choosing a local manufacturer, customers have the privilege of receiving competent advice from a specialist who has first-hand understanding and knowledge of the local conditions.
Immediate solution delivered This is one of the best advantages of a domestic manufacturer; immediate solutions can be delivered right away. If a customer requests prompt delivery of commodities, the local manufacturer can comply with this urgent request without any hesitation.
