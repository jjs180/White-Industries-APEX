Please welcome our new CEO
and Group Managing Director

Due to the rapid expansion of White Industries both nationally and internationally, the Board has restructured the Management team. As a result, Bruce White has been appointed  the Group Managing Director, with a primary focus on our real estate and investment portfolios. Bruce will now be based in the main street of town.

Craig White has been appointed  the CEO of Manufacturing and will be managing the day to day operation of the Foundry. Craig has worked in the business for 30 years, with dual trade qualifications and an extensive knowledge of how White Industries operates and is well equipped to drive our company’s growth going forward, as we approach nearly 60 years servicing the Australian Casting Market.

With the support of our excellent management team, our customers should see very little difference in how we operate as we enter this new phase for White Industries.

Round up of our attendance at Land Forces Expo 2016

September saw the hosting of Land Forces 2016, Australasia’s largest gathering of local and international defence forces personnel, Army contractors, equipment suppliers and industry leaders from across the land warfare spectrum. The event featured more than 500 exhibitors and attracted a record number of 13,451 delegates with representatives from 23 countries.

Defence Industries Queensland actively promotes the state’s extensive land-defence capabilities to prime contractors, defence departments and other key stakeholders, and the biennial Land Forces event is the perfect opportunity to showcase these capabilities. The Queensland Government hosted 13 local companies on a trade stand with an impressive range of innovation and capability from niche products to heavy vehicles.

White Industries got the opportunity to make some great contacts from the exhibition as well as catching up with customers who were attending the expo as delegates.


AFI Conference 2016 – Gaining knowledge from industry specialists

The annual AFI Conference was held from 9th-12th October in Geelong. Over the two day conference, 40 papers were presented by industry specialists on different aspects of research and development/collaboration, performance and productivity and diecasting within our industry. Attending these informative presentations assits White Industries to keep at the forefront of technology.

White Industries’ attendees included Directors Craig, Neil, Bruce, Bruce&apos;s  wife Karen and our very own AFI QLD Moulding Achiever for 2016, Adrian Lambert. Adrian thoroughly enjoyed the experience and walked away learning a lot from meeting and networking with people from within the industry. The highlight of the trip, as always, was the conference dinner.




Record low absenteeism levels

In October, 40% of White Industries’ employees were presented with awards for &apos;no absenteeism within the last twelve months&apos;. 10% of employees received awards with no more than one day sick. That means 50% of our staff recorded low or no absenteeism for a period of 12 months, which breaks our White Industries record thus far!

This achievement highlights the White Industries values and ethics and exemplifies our strong position in relation to high staff morale and commitment to every day team work. Well done to all those who received awards.
